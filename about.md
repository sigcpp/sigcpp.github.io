title: "About SIGCPP"
---

SIGCPP is the Special Interest Group on C++. The primary goal of the SIG is to learn,
teach, and practice software design and implementation in C++. It is a place for students,
teachers, and practitioners to freely discuss, present, write, and practice all things C++.

Although activities focus on C++, much of the material should translate to comparable
languages such as Java and C\#.

SIGCPP was founded by [Sean Murthy](https://smurthys.github.io) in May 2018.

### Activities

Typical activities include discussions, presentations, technical writing \(blog posts and
the like\), and implementation. Most implementation is done using sound
software-engineering principles of design, testing, documentation, and version control.

Most work products are hosted on GitHub and distributed free of cost for non-commercial
use. The exact license can vary across work products, but CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 and MIT License
are common models.

### Membership

The SIG is meant for anyone who consistently demonstrates genuine alignment with the SIG's
mission. Anyone interested in C++ is welcome to join. Students and faculty members \(from
any university, anywhere in the world\) are especially welcome.

There is no cost to join the SIG. Moderators review membership inquiries and accept
members based on the potential contribution the prospect and the SIG can make to each
other.

**Note:** In general, SIGCPP is **not** a place to learn basic C++ syntax and concepts.
By basic syntax and concepts we mean material that is learned in a first academic course
on C++. The pre-requisite knowledge does not have to come from a university course.

### Code of Conduct

All members are expected to consistently and actively participate in the SIG's activities;
freely share ideas, code, and knowledge with all members; and otherwise interact with all
members in a fair and friendly manner that is consistent with the SIG's mission. 

Members are expected to provide constructive feedback. They should also be willing to both
receive and apply feedback. All interactions should foster learning.

Moderators attempt to work with lurkers to get them to actively participate in the SIG's
activities. Habitually inactive members will quite likely lose membership.

No member may discriminate against any person; harass any person physically,
mentally, sexually, or otherwise; or conduct themselves in any manner that hurts or
puts another person at a disadvantage. Members may also not hold or use someone's
personal beliefs, preferences, or circumstances (including but not limited to
nationality, gender, sexuality, presentation, place of birth, lineage, and name)
against them. These exepctations apply to members even if the other person in
question is not a member.

Moderators may consider member conduct even in non-SIGCPP activities in determining
a member's adherence with this code of conduct. The penalty for code violation
depends on incident particulars and includes potential loss of membership.

### Meetings

Most discussions and presentations are on **Microsoft Teams**. Meetings are scheduled as
needed. Meetings typically last 1-2 hours with the goal of making each meeting long enough
to be productive. Outside scheduled meetings, members are encouraged to freely interact
with and learn from each other.

Meeting attendees are encouraged to participate from a computer \(instead of a mobile
device\). Participation by video is encouraged, but video is not always required. All
attendees should be willing to share their screen during the meeting.

Attendees should be able to edit and run C++ programs, browse web pages, and read
documentation on their own computer during meetings. They may use any local/online C++
environment that supports at least C++ 17. Members frequently use GCC, VS Code,
and Compiler Explorer.
